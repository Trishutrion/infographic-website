            <h3>Chosen Topic with Reasons </h3>
            The topic we chose is the impact of VCE subject choices on student lifestyles. <br> 
            This is because as VCE students, we understand the strain of the VCE program, so by informing students on such a topic, they can make more informed choices. <br>
            We can also contrast the lifestyle of VCE students with those of non-VCE students, which might lead to interesting findings. 

            <h3>Purpose of our Infographic Website</h3>
            Our infographic website aims to inform students about the possible impact of their VCE subject choices on their lifestyle. <br>
            We hope we can share our learnings about the VCE to other students through this website, and further prepare them for what the VCE has to offer.   
            
            <h3>Intended Target Audience</h3>
            The website is targeted towards teenaged students who live in Victoria, as these people are most likely to enter the VCE program, hence obtaining data from this demographic would be the most beneficial and accurate for our infographics. 
            
            <h3>Primary Data</h3>
            Our primary data is from our survey about how the choice of VCE subjects affects metrics such as sleep duration, physical activity, and average SAC scores. <br>
            These metrics are standard measurements of the lifestyle of our target audience, hence we have chosen them to quantify our data.
            
            <h3>Secondary Data</h3>
            To further reinforce our conclusions and potentially draw new ones, we plan to use secondary data about the average scores and the scaling of subjects from the VCAA website. <br> 
            This data will be used to contrast the lifestyles of VCE students with non-VCE students to determine the impact of the VCE on student lifestyle.
            
            <h3>Maintaining Data Integrity</h3>
            In order to obtain reliable data, we have made it so that each person can only respond to our survey once in order to prevent individuals from responding multiple times and skewing the data. <br> 
            Our secondary data is obtained from credible and reputable sources, namely the VCAA website. 
            
            <h3>Ethical Data Usage</h3>
            In order to ensure our data is collected ethically, we have not asked the participants for any personally identifiable information, including but not limited to, their name, residential address, and family relations, hence keeping the data anonymous. <br>
            We will also not use this data for any purpose other than website, nor will we reveal it to any other parties. <br>
