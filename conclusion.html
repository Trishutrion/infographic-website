                <h3>Our Findings</h3>
                In conclusion, the impact of VCE subjects on the lifestyle of JMSS students is significant and multifaceted. <br>
                The data highlights a distinct preference for technical subjects such as Mathematics and Science, aligning with the school's specialization in these fields. <br>
                Despite lower average scores in Mathematics compared to Performing Arts, the higher scaling suggests greater academic challenge and reward. <br>
                This trend reflects JMSS students' optimistic anticipation of achieving higher study scores and their distinct attitude towards academic pursuits. <br> 
                Moreover, the data underscores the school's emphasis on STEM fields, with a majority of students likely to pursue careers in related disciplines. <br> 
                Overall, the correlation between VCE subject choices and student lifestyle at JMSS underscores a culture of academic rigor and ambition among its student body. <br>
