            <h3>About Us</h3>
            As VCE students ourselves, we understand the challenges that come with the VCE program. <br>
            That's why we've chosen to explore the impact of VCE subject choices on student lifestyles. <br>
            Our mission is to provide valuable insights and information to help fellow students make informed decisions about their VCE journey.<br>
            <br>
            The chosen topic for the infographic website is the impact of VCE subject choices on student lifestyles. <br>
            The purpose is to inform VCE students about the potential effects of their subject choices on various aspects of their lives. <br> 
            The goal is to share insights and help students make informed decisions. <br>
            The target audience is teenage students in Victoria, as they are likely to enter the VCE program. <br> 
            Primary data for the project comes from a survey that explores the influence of VCE subjects on sleep duration, physical activity, and average SAC scores. <br>
            Secondary data from the VCAA website will be used to compare the lifestyles of VCE and non-VCE students. <br> 
            To maintain data integrity, measures have been taken to prevent multiple survey responses from the same individual. <br> 
            Ethical data usage is prioritized by collecting anonymous data without personally identifiable information and ensuring that the <br>
            information is solely used for the website and not shared with third parties. <br>
